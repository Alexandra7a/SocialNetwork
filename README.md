<h1>Social Network </h1>
<h2>🎯 Purpose: </h2>
<p>The project is made in order to facilitate the communication between friends in an online manner. It simulates the functionalities of a real-world scenario by pairing users together through friend requests. They can accept requests, send and reply to messages. The application also has an 'admin' view where the user account CRUD operations can be fulfilled and a paging repository to help display a specific number of users in the main table. </p>

<h2>👩🏻‍💻 Technology Used:</h2>
<p>I worked in java and javafx communicating with a postgresql DB</p>
<h2>📋 The structure of the project:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Main-view - an overview of the admin window where a log-in button exists
      <ul>
      <li>add - in order to create a new account another window opens and the admin must enter the blank spaces with required information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Log-in window - the user must enter its username to be able to enter the app</li>
  <li>The account window- the actual window where the chat and a list of friends is seen and a request friend message can be sent</li>
</ul>
