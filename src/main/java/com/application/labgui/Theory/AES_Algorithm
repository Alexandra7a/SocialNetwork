obs: you can add a short example of hos important the password is and how easy it can be broken
if too short or too basic
obs2: add the little story with some pictures
'I want to star the presentation by addressing you a question: How much attention do you pay when choosing a password?
telling you a story about this person (insert news about broken accounst here)'

 - A symmetric cipher uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption.
 A block cipher means it works on 128 bits blocks of the input Plaintext.

When it comes to cryptographic key sizes, such as AES-128 with a 128-bit key,
 there are 2^128 possible unique keys because each bit in the key can be independently
 set to 0 or 1, resulting in an enormous number of potential
 combinations (2^128 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456) - ENORMOUS
        => time, energy and money consuming task...
        hence, daunting for a brute force approach

    For a much longer sequrnce of bits aka the size of the key being 192 or 256, makes the kob even
    more difficult


 AES-128 keys are 128 bits, which means there are 2^128 possible values. It’d take a humongous and infeasible
 amount of time and money to search through this. Hence, AES is practically unbreakable by a brute-force approach.

 There have been a few non-brute-force approaches but these could only reduce the possible key lookup space
 by a couple of bits.

 All this means is that with zero knowledge about the key, AES is practically impossible to break.


 Ways to provide the secret key:
 1. Random class in java
 2. SecureRandom class in java
 3. KeyGenerator from Java’s crypto package -> javax.crypto
4. Password-Based Key
        -based on the actual human-readable password
        -a password is not commonly 128 bits long so we use salt to generate more random characters
        after the orriginal one to be more secure(? so how does the decription mode go then de unde stim cat e introdus de user si cat nu)
